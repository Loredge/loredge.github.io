		<h2 class="f11">Our Journey</h2>

		<p class="f6">Loredge was born out of thirst for knowledge and the desire to collaborate with others around learning new things.<br><br>

		Anna Abelin, CEO and founder of Loredge spent 8 years at California Institute of Technology (Caltech, US) of which during the last 5 years she did a PhD in Biology and Biological Engineering. During countless of hours searching for interesting articles and reading as many as possible, she quickly became frustrated over how inefficient the reading process was. Despite trying various systems of organising printed articles and later trying all digital products available, the knowledge obtained while reading was still fading as soon as the article was put aside. <q>How can we make all this knowledge accessible at any time?</q> she wondered. <br><br>

		When Anna returned to Stockholm in 2014 she asked herself what kind of tool she would have wanted during the graduate years. The perfect tool for finding, reading, and organising the knowledge obtained from published articles. And also, how can we do all this collaborative with others?<br><br>

		The answer is Loredge.</p>
